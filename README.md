Elixir and Phoenix. 

Phoenix is a web framework that built in Elixir and runs on Erlang VM.

Erlang VM: Erlang VM was invented in 1986 for phone switches. It is a general-purpose programming language and runtime environment. Runtime environment means that the code is compiled, runs everywhere, and can be update without crashing anything. It works with functional programing. 

What is functioning programming you may ask:
Type of computer programming that avoids changing states and mutable data. It uses pure functions. By using functional programming the same input will always give the same output so functions are independent from other functions. This is unlike object oriented programming which shares states in objects and methods so you could get different outputs. States can be changed with object oriented programming.

Okay back to Elixir and Phoenix - What is Elixir?
José Valim, who worked with Rails, saw potential in Erlang and its productivity but wanted to modernize it. Elixir is thus a functional language that is built on Erlang. You can think about it like the modern version of Erlang. It’s syntax is similar to Ruby. 

Ruby + Rails vs Elixir + Phoenix
Looks like Ruby and Rails are very similar but Ruby/Rails is a bit more popular. One major difference is Ruby/Rails is object oriented whereas Elixir/Phoenix is functional. Since Erlang has such great productivity and speed, Elixir/Phoenix is faster.

What is it especially good for?
It is used for websites. It is particular good for chat and voice applications. 
Example companies that use it: WhatsApp and Pinterest

Using their tutorial we set up a real time chat application with Elixir and Phoenix.
